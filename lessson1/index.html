<p> The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company.[1][2][3]
  The series is a satirical depiction of American life, epitomized by the Simpson family, which consists of Homer,
  Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American
  culture and society, television, and the human condition. </p>

<p>Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956)[40] is a man from Springfield. He is the spouse of Marge Simpson and father of
  Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be 239 pounds)[41], lazy, and often ignorant to the
  world around him. Although he has many flaws, he has shown to have great caring, love, and even bravery to those he
  cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't.

  His favorite color is blue, and he enjoys dancing, eating donuts, drinking, hugging, driving a sit-down arcade
  racer, playing the piano and horse riding. His favorite kiddie rides are "Stuart Little", "Barney Train" and "Ride
  the Champion Mechanical Horse".

  Homer works as a low-level safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in Sector 7G, although he is
  often incompetent and negligent towards his duties. He spends a great deal of his time at Moe's Tavern with his
  friends Barney Gumble, Carl Carlson, Lenny Leonard, and Moe Szyslak. At home, he can often be found sitting on the
  couch mindlessly watching TV while snacking on food and drinking Duff. Homer is also the only son of Abraham Simpson
  II and Mona Simpson. When provoked, he often strangles Bart for pressuring him. Even though he mutually hates his
  wife's sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier, he played Selma's husband for her to adopt Ling and agreed to be the
  minister for Patty's intended homosexual marriage. As a result of this, Homer is her legal adoptive father.[42]

  Homer may just be a normal man, but he has had many great achievements and experiences in his life. He has won a
  Grammy, an Academy Award, a Pulitzer Prize, been to space and saved Springfield many times.</p>

<p>Bartholomew JoJo "Bart" Simpson (born Feburary 23 or April 1, 1980)is the mischievous, rebellious, misunderstood,
  disruptive and "potentially dangerous" oldest child of the Simpson family in The Simpsons. He is the only son of
  Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. He also has been nicknamed "Cosmo", after
  discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the cover on numerous comics, such as "Critical Hit",
  "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a 100-issue comic series entitled the Simpson
  Comics Presents Bart Simpson. Bart is loosely based on Matt Groening and his older brother, Mark Groening.
